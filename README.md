# TO-DO-LIST
Developed a dynamic and interactive to-do list application that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Utilized HTML for the structure, CSS for a responsive and user-friendly design, and JavaScript for client-side functionality, including real-time task and local storage to persist data across sessions.
